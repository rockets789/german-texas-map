When Methodist missionary Henry Stephenson arrived in Texas in 1834, he found plans underway for a camp meeting. At an 1835 meeting, future Alamo hero William Barret Travis was a featured speaker, and promised to assist in the effort to bring Methodist preachers to Texas. Missionary Robert Alexander conducted services at the Caney Creek camp meeting site in August 1839. Methodists continued to use the campground for worship services until the early 1880s, when the land was sold. Funds from the sale were used to build a German Methodist Episcopal Church in Bellville in 1882. The building was used by German and English speaking congregations on alternate Sundays. The Methodist Episcopal Church, south, was organized in 1886, and a new sanctuary was completed on this site that year. The Rev. J.P. Childers served as the first minister.

Courthouse facilities acquired in 1849 proved inadequate and were replaced with a 2-story building at the southeast corner of the city plaza in 1860. The building fell into disrepair and in 1898 the county chose famous Texas courthouse architect J. Riley Gordon to design a new courthouse. Gordon's original design, incorporating four entrances compatible with the building's proposed location at the center of the plaza, was nevertheless retained when this corner lot site was chosen instead . Austin contractors Fischer and Lamie used stone quarried 10 miles north of New Braunfels on land owned by Texas/U.S.statesman Edward Mandell House to build this courthouse in 1898. The 3 1/2 story Romanesque-style structure features rounded pavilion entrances often employed by Gordon and includes dramatic massing and superb detail in its stone work. A 1929-31 large stone jail addition was designed by Jeremiah Schmidt of New Braunfels. The courthouse underwent considerable interior and minor exterior renovations in 1966-67 and 1987.

""Forty-niners"", supplies for frontier forts, and experimental Army camels were landed here landed here. During the Civil War Indianola and Fort Esperanza, which controlled the gateway to Indianola through Pass Cavallo, were objectives of Federal blockading vessels. Pass Cavallo, ten miles south, was one of several entrances to the inside waterway created by Matagorda Peninsula and the offshore islands extending to the Rio Grande. To deny Confederate use of this waterway for commerce through Mexico the Federals had to seize control of these entrances. Before Confederate defenses at Fort Esperanza were completed, two Federal steamers slipped through Pass Cavallo to Indianola and on October 31, 1862 demanded the surrender of Lavaca (now Port Lavaca) to the northwest. The Confederate command refused, stood off the naval guns with land batteries, and forced the withdrawal of the Federal ships. Federal forces attacked Fort Esperanza November 22, 1863. The Confederates withstood the assault of naval and land forces for six days then spiked their guns, destroyed their magazines, and withdrew to the mainland. Indianola then fell December 23. On Christmas Eve, Federal and Confederate forces clashed at Norris Bridge, eight miles north. Two days later Lavaca was occupied and the entire Matagorda-Lavaca Bay area remained in Federal control until the war's end. Indianola was partially destroyed by a hurricane in 1875 and completely destroyed by another in 1886. A memorial to Texans who served the Confederacy.

When the railroad came through the area in 1892, the Lindemann Store expanded its freighting operation.

Upon arrival in Texas in late 1844, Zink realized that the grant to be settled by the colonists was in the heart of Comanche Indian territory. He persuaded Prince Solms to settle at an alternate site, which became the town of New Braunfels. Zink's leadership in the face of unrest, disease, starvation, and monetary problems was vital to the survival of the colony. He eventually was responsible for the supervision of about one-half of the German immigrants bound for New Braunfels. After 1847, Zink built homes in a variety of places, including Sisterdale, Comfort, and an area south of Fredericksburg. In 1868, he acquired this property and built the central portion of the limestone house southeast of this site.

It was near roads connecting major Texas cities. Many roadside homes in early Texas were inns. The horseback traveler would shelter his pony in the barn, share family meals, get a room for the night. All stage lines depended on such accommodations-- for changes of horses, for passengers' meals, and for overnight stops. With travel difficult at best, such inns rendered a service of great public necessity. A frontier inn might even be a dugout, where the guests rolled up in blankets and slept on the floor. (Travelers sometimes had to sleep under a tree, so any sort of sheltering house was usually welcomed.) Most stage stops dispatched and received U.S. mail for the community.

One year later he mapped a trade route to Eagle Pass on the Mexican border. In 1852 he became county surveyor, an office he held until his death. He also served as city alderman, 1852-56. During the Civil War Von Blucher joined the Confederacy and designed and directed the placement of fortifications in Corpus Christi and the South Texas coastal area. After his death in 1879, his children built homes here on family land, which became known as Blucherville.

Lake Texoma was promoted largely through the efforts of Sam Rayburn (1882-1961), noted speaker of the house who represented District 4 in Congress for 49 years. In normal operation, lake shoreline covers 550 miles, with the Red River arm (45 miles) in Texas and the Washita arm (30 miles) in Oklahoma covering 93,080 acres. The waters are impounded by Denison Dam. When Texoma was created, it caused the relocation of railroads, highways, utilities, and cemeteries. The site of Preston, historically the Red River crossing for the Butterfield Stage, was submerged, as were the sites of Hagerman and part of Cedar Mills, Texas. In 1966 numerous recreation areas on Texoma drew 8,500,000 tourists, who could also visit Eisenhower State Park at the southeast end of the lake. The park was named in honor of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the thirty-fourth president of the United States. Texoma is one of more than 200 major inland lakes and reservoirs in Texas which contribute greatly to the economic and industrial growth of the state.

His family lived in this vicinity, and he attended nearby Orr School on Laurel Street. His early musical training came from his father, Giles Joplin, an ex-slave who played the fiddle, and mother, Florence Givens Joplin, who played the banjo. By tradition, a German music teacher realized Joplin's talent and gave him lessons. Joplin left home at age 14 and wandered through the midwest entertaining in saloons and honky-tonks. In the 1890s, he was one of the originators of ragtime, a rhythmic new musical form that combined black and white musical traditions. Joplin's ""Maple Leaf Rag"", published in 1899, launched ragtime as a national fad. Joplin defended ragtime against those who called it frivolous and worked constantly to refine his music, which included over 30 piano rags. Demand for ragtime had declined by 1917, when Joplin died in New York City. Joplin's background is revealed in his most ambitious work, the black folk opera ""Treemonisha"", set on a plantation ""northeast of the town of Texarkana"".

The ship was launched on June 28, 1919, the same day Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, officially ending World War I. As a result, the 7,500-ton ship never entered the war, but instead was placed into service as an oil tanker in the Gulf of Mexico. In Tampico, Mexico, on May 31, 1920, the SS Selma hit a jetty, ripping a hole in its hull about 60 feet long. After attempts to repair the ship in Galveston failed and efforts to sell the ship proved unsuccessful, U.S. officials decided to intentionally scuttle the ship. A channel 1,500 feet long and 25 feet deep was dug to a point just off Pelican Island's eastern shoreline where on March 9, 1922, the ship was laid to rest.

Long a source of curiosity and local legend, it remains important to scientists who continued to study aspects of its concrete construction.

Pioneers from such faraway places as England, Germany, Connecticut, Maryland and Georgia were drawn to the new town, which was platted in 1848 and soon called Bellville by popular vote. A courthouse and jail were erected in 1848 and Bellville's first hotel opened in 1849. Within ten years, the booming town boasted about fifteen businesses. The Civil War left the town nearly deserted, and as in many similar Texas towns it was difficult to rebuild during the Reconstruction era. Positive growth began about 1877 as new business ventures took root. In 1880 the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway arrived in Bellville, and the population doubled rapidly. The Episcopal and German Methodist churches organized about 1881, and the Bellville Standard newspaper was established in 1882. A telephone company began operations and a library was established by 1886. Cotton production rose in the late 1890s and more than 10,000 bales were shipped each growing season. By the turn of the century Bellville was thriving both culturally and economically. Oil replaced cotton as the area's major industry in 1915 when black gold was discovered around Bellville. Development of local oil fields further spurred the town's growth and continued to help support Bellville throughout the 20th century. (1999)",False,False,True,29.94966214997437,-96.25821700481092

They renamed the station Marienfeld and established a German Catholic colony. Under the leadership of Anastasius Peters, the Carmelites attracted immigrant farmers to the area, some of whom joined the religious order. In 1884, this building was constructed to serve as the living quarters for the friars; it was expanded in 1886. From here they journeyed all over west Texas and eastern New Mexico, ministering to the Catholic families in communities along the rail lines and starting new Catholic parishes. Their work in Marienfeld had a direct impact on the town's development and on the formal organization of Martin County in 1884. In 1888, the Marienfeld Carmelites numbered 34, but severe drought during that period resulted in an economic depression that led to faltering support for the friars and the colony. By 1891, only five friars remained, and they left in 1901. In 1897, the Carmelites sold the monastery building to the Sisters of Mercy, who developed an academy on the site in 1898 and used this building for their living quarters and chapel. Soon after a 1938 tornado swept through the complex, the Sisters of Mercy withdrew, and the property was sold. Built of adobe in the Gothic Revival style, the monastery features four-foot thick walls, a stone foundation, Gothic pointed-arch windows and a wrapround porch. It is the only building remaining from the Carmelite occupation of the site. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark - 2000 ",False,False,True,32.13213069469638,-101.78896899458529

Dallas' economic growth and the coming of the automobile age after the turn of the 20th century led to a great demand for Stubbs' expertise in modern paving techniques. By 1922, he had patented vibrolithic paving and was noted as one of the chief authorities on paving in the United States. His business success led to the construction of this house in the fashionable Swiss Avenue neighborhood. Completed in 1926, the Stubbs House may have been the work of Dallas architect Otto H. Lang. The design drew upon features of England's Tudor manor houses, a style popular in American residential architecture between World Wars I and II. Hallmark features of the style, including the steeply pitched roof, half-timbered gables, distinctive chimneys and low pointed-arch entry, are present in the house, which was home to Robert and Marie Stubbs and their two children. A separate two-story garage and staff quarters also reflects Tudor characteristics. Following R. C. Stubbs' death just one year after the house was completed, Marie continued to live and entertain here until 1940. The house subsequently was converted into apartments, but was returned to single-family use in the 1970s.

Although Texas did not have a system of free public education at that time, it did offer subsidies for students attending private tuition schools who could not pay. The German-Texans organized a number of schools under this system, paying for teachers and buildings with a combination of state funds, donations and tuition. In September 1857, the German-Texans in Austin held a public meeting to establish a German school for the city. Civil engineer Wilhelm von Rosenberg donated land at this site for the school. Within a month, German-Texan volunteers began construction of the school building. The first school in Austin chartered by the Texas Legislature, the German Free School Association opened in 1858 with August Weilbacher and Julius Schutze as its first teachers. The 1857 building with rammed earth outer walls contained two classrooms and a basement. About 1872, a two-story limestone section was added to provide four additional classrooms. Julius Schutze returned to teach in 1880 and moved his family into the schoolhouse. They continued to live in the building after the school closed in 1881 with the advent of Austin's public school system.

In 1867, Anton and Lucyia Koszielsky deeded land at this site to the church, and the building that was constructed was dedicated to St. Mary. After it burned in 1915, the parish hired architect F. B. Gaenslen to design their new building. Completed in 1916, the building utilized the cross from the steeple on the former church and thus came to be called Holy Cross. Construction work was overseen by Falbo Contractors of San Antonio, with much of the labor supplied by parishioners. Gaenslen's design for a simplified Romanesque style church was carried out in red brick, with polychrome brick detailing on the tower. Its Romanesque features are evident in its tower, semi-circular arched windows and corbelled parapet. Since 1916, Holy Cross Catholic Church has served Catholics in Yorktown and the surrounding area. The building stands as an architectural landmark in the region, as it houses the parish's ongoing ministries of worship, education and outreach.

They donated land for the first Schumannsville community school. Named Altwein School in their honor, it was moved closer to the town in 1879 and renamed Unionwein School. Located about one-half mile east of this site is the Altwein family cemetery, established in 1853 upon Johann GotthÃ¼lf Altwein's death. Three months after purchasing the farm, he was working to clear the land and suffered a fatal heatstroke. Only one grave in the cemetery is marked with a headstone - that of two-year-old grandson, Herrman R. Altwein (1880-1882). Family history records at least fourteen burials at the site, some marked with simple native rocks. Interments also include those of Herrman's parents, Wilhelm (1840-1915) and Louise Staats (1847-1888) Altwein, and two of their daughters, one named Otillia (1884-1886). Also believed to be buried in the family graveyard are two children of a local Mexican laborer; the Altweins' oldest daughter Augusta (1830-1901), her husband Johannes Krams and their daughters Augusta Krams Dammann and Matilda Krams, who all died in 1883. Another daughter, Bertha Matilda Krams Scheffell (1861-1933), was the last person interred in the family cemetery. The Altwein family is representative of the many German immigrants who came to Texas in the 19th century, and their legacy continues with descendants still living in the region.

Martin, Johanna and her parents moved to the new community of Selma, then known as Cibolo, in 1855. They bought 127 acres of land and established a farm for each family. In 1869, Geier and Schmid agreed to split the land, each receiving a portion. Martin and Johanna Schmid reared four children in Selma: William, Sam, Sedonia Haile and Mary Elizabeth Wuest. Martin, a Civil War veteran who served under Capt.

The State of Texas issued the church's charter in September of that year. The first sanctuary was a wooden building on the southeast corner of Texas Avenue at Milam Street. In 1901, under the Rev. William L. Blasberg (1862-1935), the congregation moved to the northwest corner of Texas at Caroline, to a new red brick and sandstone sanctuary. After selling the second structure in 1926, the First Evangelical Church, as it became known, purchased this site. Under the leadership of the Rev. Detlev Baltzer (1889-1962), the congregation hired architect Joseph W. Northrop, Jr., who had moved to Houston to oversee construction of the original Rice Institute, now Rice University. James West was general contractor for the new church campus, and J.C Nolan and the Star Electric and Engineering company held sub-contracts. Northrop's North Italian Romanesque styling features terra cotta roof tiles on the sanctuary, education building and parsonage, as well as a campanile, or bell tower.

Eaker enlisted in the army on April 7, 1917, one day after the U.S. declared war on Germany. He was recruited into the army's early aviation program and continued his pilot training through the war, after which he commanded a squadron in the Philippines. There he helped devise an aircraft level instrument, which was further developed by the Air Corps Materiel Division. In 1926-27, Eaker served as a pilot in the Pan American Goodwill tour. He also conceived and tested innovative flight procedures. During the 1930s, he earned a journalism degree and graduated from the Army Command and General Staff School in Kansas. At the outbreak of World War II, Eaker was sent to England to organize and oversee the U.S. 8th Army Air Force Bomber Command, coordinating efforts with the Royal Air Force in round-the-clock bombing of Germany's war works. He sometimes accompanied his men, believing a commander should know what his troops face in combat. He commanded the 8th Army Air Force and later the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Near war's end, he served at the Pentagon as Deputy Commanding General of the Army Air Forces. Eaker retired in 1947 and worked for Howard Hughes and then for Douglas Aircraft Company, from which he retired in 1961.

Ervendberg and Dr. Joseph Anton Fischer founded the town's first school. Fischer is recognized as the first teacher in Industry, and Ervendberg is credited as being tutor to the children of town founder Frederick Ernst. Tutors were common, with families hiring teachers to give lessons in their homes. By 1842, 37 area residents had petitioned the Texas Congress for the creation of a German institute of higher learning, Hermann's University. The school received its charter in 1844, and although the charter was amended in 1846 when Texas became a state, the project never materialized. Accustomed to the free education offered in their native Germany, Industry settlers were part of the free public school movement in Texas. In 1864, Civil War veteran Christian William Hander opened a school in the residence of the Niebuhr family. His school grew out of the private home and became the Industry day school in 1865. Other schools at that time were operated by Rudolph Franke and John Simmons. These schools required tuition, though, from their students. Austin County established several public schools by 1880, including five in Industry, which created its own school district in 1912. Nearby Star Hill consolidated with it in 1928. Legislation in 1948 consolidated Industry, Shelby, Henkhaus, Rockhouse and New Bremen into West End Rural High School District, with grades 1-9 in Industry and 10-12 in Bellville. The district erected a new brick building in 1952, as well as a new structure for the African American campus, the Mary Bethune School. Following integration, the school consolidated into the Bellville Independent School District. The 1952 West End School building continued to serve as an elementary campus for the children of the area. 											(2002) ",False,False,True,29.965550684304883,-96.50139944845911

Later additions accommodated the growing family, which included thirteen children, eight of whom survived into adulthood. According to family history, a daughter, Mathilda, was abducted from the home as a toddler by raiding Indians. A group from the nearby Powderhouse Hill neighborhood formed a posse and brought her back. Located along Texas' western frontier, San Antonio was prey to such attacks throughout much of the early 1800s. Anna Barbara worked as a midwife. Johann (or John), a stonemason, worked on the church, rectory, and St. Joseph's Society's Hall of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, a German parish established in 1871. He probably built his homes on this site, beginning work on this larger house between 1882 and 1884. The west side of the structure abuts the Acequia Madre, also known as the Alamo Madre, a major canal built by Franciscan friars and their Indian converts to provide water for Mission San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo) and its farmlands. Originally covered with lime wash, the limestone and caliche rock house is typical of the Texas German vernacular style once common in the city. The Heidgen family lived here until 1907.

There, he found work in a mercantile store. Following military service in the Civil War, Goldman moved to Victoria in 1865 and established his own mercantile firm. He became a successful businessman, with other endeavors including dairying, farming, grist milling and cotton ginning.

Over the next several years, Goldman bought surrounding property and developed a successful ginning operation, which he continually updated with new equipment and structures. With immediate access to the rail line that ran along East Street, Goldman was able to manage other cotton-related operations at this site, including warehouses for area cotton growers.

It was also a focal point for German settlers, including Carl Wunsche, who was prominent in the town's development. The area still has a strong German heritage. A new rail line reached Spring in the early 20th century and, with a roundhouse and railway shops, the town grew in importance as a rail center. Developer R.l. Robinson subdivided land south of the original town, and the commercial area shifted to accommodate the rail junction. The railroads facilitated the development of the lumber industry; Spring boasted a number of mills, both large and small, in the boom era of lumber production. With the boom came the need for new businesses, including hotels, saloons, an opera house, gambling houses, a hospital and a bank. In 1907, residents established the Spring Independent School District. The loss of the roundhouse and the onset of Prohibition led to population decline, and the saloons, hotels, and other rail-supported businesses closed in the 1920s. Still, the dwindling community persisted, creating a volunteer fire department in the 1950s and sustaining its school district, which integrated in the mid-1960s. As the population began to grow again in the early 1970s, new businesses opened, including many specialty shops. With its proximity to a growing urban center and, itself an area commercial center, Spring continues to attract new residents and businesses but retains its unique identity and its link to its early history.

Fuenning pastored until fall of 1904, when the St. Paul congregation called the Rev. A. Wenzel of the Missouri Synod. That year, church trustees built a sanctuary at this site on land purchased from C.P. and Anna Vogelsang. Mrs. Charles Siebel sold the church land for a parsonage. The congregation later joined the old Texas Synod and then the Iowa Synod, from which it called the Rev. Julius Bosshard in 1908. Bosshard remained until 1920, then returned in 1930 to serve until his death in 1947. Other St. Paul pastors during the first half of the 20th century included the Revs. M.C. Hoermann and E.J.

Women were also not permitted to vote in congregational decisions. These practices were revised in the 1940s. As the congregation grew, it joined the Texas District and later the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, also adding facilities to its property.

He led a group of Sherman residents in forming a church in 1871, and by late 1874 the members had constructed a sanctuary on Travis Street, between Pecan and Mulberry streets. Throughout the 1870s, the city of Sherman grew as a result of new rail lines through the community. The congregation, known as First Presbyterian Church, grew along with the city. By 1886, the church had established a chapel in a growing part of town, and in 1894 the congregation moved to a larger sanctuary at the corner of Travis and Mulberry.
  After Austin College moved to Sherman in 1876, First Presbyterian fostered a strong relationship with its students and faculty, leading to the creation of a new congregation, the College Park Presbyterian Church, closer to campus. First Church and the school's pre-ministerial students also established a short-lived Sunday School mission in the 1940s. During the 20th century, First Church's members maintained other educational services, including kindergarten and pre-school programs, as well as foreign mission projects.
  For more than a century, First Presbyterian Church grew and served its community, building new facilities as needed. The congregation developed close ties with the Trinity United Presbyterian congregation (Sherman), with which it united in 1995, forming Covenant Presbyterian Church. Today, Covenant Presbyterian continues the programs and services established by its historic congregations in their decades of work and worship in Sherman.

These local Brethren found it difficult to worship in area Protestant churches because of the language barrier -- most conducted services in German or English. As a result, the Czech immigrants joined together to revive practices of the Unity of the Brethren and worship in their native language. The Rev. Henry Juren of Fayetteville held Taylor's first Czech Protestant service in 1892. As more Czech Protestant immigrants arrived in central Texas, more Brethren groups formed, served by traveling ministers. Among those was the Taylor Brethren Church, formally organized in 1895. The Rev. Antonin Motycka became the church's first pastor. Three years later, the Brethren church began using space in the West Taylor Lutheran Church building at this site. In June 1902, the Brethren congregation purchased the property. The church continued holding worship services in the Czech language until 1967. Today, the congregation recognizes its rich ethnic history, but it is now a diverse body whose members reflect many backgrounds and traditions.

Armbrecht's land included the present site of the city of Winters; in 1892, he sold 100 acres for the city center and later donated two acres for use as a cemetery. As more Lutheran families arrived, the time was right to organize a church. The mission board of the Texas Synod of the Lutheran church sent missionaries to lead services held in homes and schools. Families dedicated a sanctuary in the downtown Winters area in October 1904 and formally organized on November 6 of that year as St. John's Lutheran Church. Members learned the railroad line would run adjacent to their property when it arrived in 1909, so they built a new sanctuary on the west side of town. Facilities have expanded over the years and include the present sanctuary, constructed in 1930. The congregation grew, and its members participated actively in Winters' development and social activities. Many parishioners operated local businesses, and others entertained the community with their musical talents. Although church members served in the U.S. armed forces, local anti-German sentiment during the first World War led to the congregation minimizing its services, which were held in German; relations slowly mended following the war. During the Second World War, congregation members maintained their visible and patriotic role in supprt of U.S. involvement overseas.

It was administered jointly by the Army and select federal agencies, such as the National Park Service. On July 10, 1935, Army Captain Tom B.

Designated SP-55-TX, it began with several frame buildings, including barracks, a mess hall, a blacksmith shop, and a combination woodworking, repair and storage facility.

In 1902, Japanese consul general Sadatsuchi Uchinda attended a Beaumont meeting of the Rice Growers Association of America, who offered an open invitation to Japanese rice farmers. Yoshio Mayumi, a banker and landowner from Mie prefecture on the main island of Honshu, visited this area in 1904 and returned the following year to purchase more than 1,700 acres near Taylor Bayou. Mayumi brought fifteen workers from his hometown, and the farming community included a three-story house for Mayumi's family, another building for the workmen and a community dance hall. Although Yoshio's only crop was rice, he also owned and raised livestock, including hogs and cattle, and to help with farm work, mules and horses. The agricultural experiment showed early promise, but several factors led to its eventual decline. Yoshio returned to Japan in 1915 and left the operation to the management of his brother Yasuo. Economic difficulties and repressive immigration laws led the Mayumi family to sell the land in 1924. The Mayumi legacy, centered on a family fondly remembered for its many contributions to the rural community, is important because it presaged the success of the Texas rice industry, which is today and economic mainstay of the upper Texas Gulf coast.

Cheney served as Constable and Justice of the Peace in what was then Colorado County. His home on the west bank of the Navidad River, once including more than 7,000 acres, became known as Cheney Settlement. The Cheney family sold off portions of the family farm, and an influx of German, Austrian and Czech immigrants arrived. In 1873, Benjamin Milby opened a post office named Vienna in honor of the Austrian capital. In the 1880s, Pat Carvelle gave land for a school, which the community built with lumber hauled from Schulenburg. John Mixon operated a general store and the post office from 1885 to 1906, followed by postmaster Louis Teltschick, who also built and operated a cotton gin, sawmill, grist mill and blacksmith shop. Vienna was also a popular picnic spot in the early 20th century, with picturesque crossings of the Navidad River nearby. A July 1940 flood severely damaged the gin complex, though, and sent the Louis Teltschick family to the upper portion of the gin for shelter. The congregation of Vienna Baptist Church, founded at Seclusion (6 mi. SE) in the 1880s, moved next to the school in about 1915, the same year the post office closed.

Elmer lived a unique existence - a life without utilities in the natural setting. He also did not pay taxes and amassed a debt of more than $150,000 by 1986. Over Elmer's wishes, a court-appointed law firm worked to sell a portion of the property, which had grown significantly in monetary value, to cover the amount owed. Elmer, however, wanted to donate his land to the Audubon Society. The situation attracted national attention and soon lawyers, county officials, charities and other agencies began work to find a way to pay the bills and preserve the habitat. In 1991, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department grant enabled Harris County to buy the land. The county paid the debt and created the Kleb Woods Nature Preserve. Kleb's determination, as well as help from others, led to the preservation of a wildlife refuge in a rapidly urbanizing area.

Construction began in May 1942 after the removal of homes, churches and businesses, and the first units of the 316th Troop Carrier Group arrived in late September. The base was a replacement center for the First Troop Carrier Command, training pilots to transport combat troops and supplies. In March 1943, the base was renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field to honor Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, Austin's first casualty of war; he was killed at Clark Field in the Phillipines on December 8, 1941. The base name was shortened to Bergstrom Field in November 1943. Crews from Bergstrom saw duty in the invasions of Normandy, southern France, Holland and Germany. After the war, the air field became Bergstrom Air Force Base, assigned to the Continental Air Command, and planes from here participated in the Berlin Airlift, 1948-49. Over the next 50 years, Bergstrom served as part of both the Strategic Air Command and the Tactical Air Command, sending bombers and reconnaisance aircraft into combat theaters from Korea to Iraq. In 1968, the 12th Air Force moved its headquarters here to a newly completed circular building, nicknamed the ""Roundagon.""

The USAAF Western Flying Training Command selected Marfa as the site for an advanced multi-engine flying school in 1942. Due to an initial lack of supplies and properly trained personnel, the USAAF struggled at first to establish the command effectively and to provide adequate housing for those who served here. The airfield had four hangars, five runways and a unique angled parking apron. There were also several auxiliary fields in the area. Support personnel here included a Women's Army Corps unit established in 1943 and African American troops, assigned primarily to motor pool duties. Trainees included allied Chinese flying cadets, the first class arriving in September 1944. After Germany surrendered in May 1945, the USAAF considered deactivating Marfa Army Air Field and placed the installation on standby status. However, the need for additional transport aircraft in the Pacific campaign temporarily extended the mission of the airfield. In June 1945, the USAAF placed the airfield in the Troop Carrier Command as home of the 818th Army Air Forces Base. The USAAF formally deactivated the base in September 1945, and the gradual exodus of the military had a devastating impact on Marfa.

Charles Apelt ran the farm until he died in 1944. His wife, Martha, continued to run the business, which closed when she died in 1947. The farm reopened in 1951 before again closing in 1971. During its years of operation, the farm was a significant source of employment in the area. Although it is no longer in operation, Apelt Armadillo Farm continues to be remembered for its production of distinctive and famed souvenirs.

The small community, originally settled by german immigrants, is now known as the Plainview/Bethel Heights Community. The early organizational records of the cemetery were handwritten in German, and designated one acre to be divided into family plots of eight graves to be sold for one dollar, with the second acre to be used by the community. Minutes in 1915 show that cemetery officials decided that the cemetery would be open to persons of any nationality or skin color, with preference given to members of the church congregation and their families. Although no records exist showing an official name change, obituaries show that the cemetery came to be known as Hemmeline Cemetery during the early 1900s. American involvement in World Wars I and II may have contributed to the permanent name change. Many people and institutions dropped German references or German-sounding names at that time in order to avoid hostility.

During the Civil War, the town was used as a winter camp for the Confederacy, and as a camp for freight and cotton wagons which carried supplies from Alleyton (Colorado Co.) to Brownsville (Cameron Co.). A stagecoach provided regular service through Sweet Home, which was on the old Spanish trail between Houston and San Antonio, establishing the settlement as a thriving trading community. Residents also farmed, with cotton and corn becoming staple crops of the area. After the Civil War, Sweet Home became a thriving ranching community. George West, a noted rancher, became known for driving a herd of 14,000 cattle from Lavaca County to an Indian reservation in Montana. He also built a store, hotel and stables.

By 1900, both the I&GN and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (Katy) railroads ran weekend excursion trains to the park, where visitors enjoyed picnics, dancing and steamboat excursions on Landa Lake. Landa later sold the park to a San Antonio investment group, who operated it until financial problems caused the park's closure in 1933. In 1936, concerned citizens led by Erhard P. Nowotny petitioned the City of New Braunfels to purchase the park, and city residents voted three to one in favor of the move. The park has remained open to the public since that time.

Surrounding the intersection of Elm Street and Central Avenue in downtown Dallas, Deep Ellum was one of the largest and most dynamic urban African American communities in the United States during the early twentieth century. (The term âDeep Ellumâ probably derives from the local pronunciation of âElmâ as âEllumâ and the fact that the area was on the âdeepâ or far end of Elm street.) As large numbers of African Americans moved into the city to search for jobs, many found work with the nearby railroads, which enabled shops, restaurants and other businesses to establish in the area. Deep Ellum became well-known during the 1920s and 1930s for its nightclubs and dance halls, and many notable musicians lived and performed in the community, playing in churches, on street corners and in bars. Musician Huddie âLeadbellyâ Ledbetter (ca. 1888-1949) was born in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. Leadbelly moved to Dallas ca. 1910 and it was here that he heard his first jazz band and where he discovered the 12-string guitarâthe instrument that eventually became his favorite. Leadbelly met another musician, Blind Lemon Jefferson, in Dallas ca. 1912, and the two became musical partners, performing on street corners, in clubs, and on the interurban railroad that served the Dallas area. Leadbelly, Jefferson and their Deep Ellum colleagues influenced later generations and had a major impact on the development of American blues, country, jazz and rock music.

Brackenridge, and in 1899 he encouraged Brackenridge to donate to the city a tract of 199 acres along the San Antonio River, to be used as a park. As parks commissioner, the development of the site, later known as Brackenridge Park, fell to Mahncke, and he was directed to open the park immediately. Though he was first given a budget of only $2,500, he quickly developed a plan to create a âdriving park,â and seven miles of roads were designed and constructed. A fenced deer preserve was built by 1902, and by 1906 the menagerie included buffalo, elk, goats, sheep and fowl. While Brackenridge Park was Mahnckeâs most well-known acomplishment, he was also responsible for landscaping many public areas throughout San Antonio. Cypress trees transplanted from the Guadalupe River under his direction can still be seen today along the San Antonio River. After his death in 1906, a bust of Mahncke was erected in 1909 in Brackenridge Park; it was later moved to this park donated by Brackenridge and named in Mahnckeâs honor.",False,False,True,29.458203142861514,-98.46826787510966

The mission of SPAAF was ground and advanced flight training for glider pilots who flew the âWaco CG-4Aâ gliderââthe USAAF's primary glider during the war.

He is the only American officer in World War II to command in battle a regiment, a division, a corps, and a field army. His leadership proved essential to victory. As World War I raged in Europe, Truscott harbored a secret ambition to obtain a commission in the U.S. Army. He did not see overseas duty in France, but instead was assigned to the 17th Cavalry on the Mexican border. His years between the World Wars were typical for Army officers, involving transfers to various posts and continued military education. Truscott's first World War II assignment was to the British Isles to study amphibious landings on a hostile shore. Here, he created the first unit of army rangers. He saw his first major action in the failed August 19, 1942, allied raid on the fortified French port of Dieppe. Next he was selected to command one of Maj. Gen. George S. Patton's task forces in North Africa. Here he excelled and within four months he was given command of the 3rd Infantry Division and prepared them for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily (July 1943). Major General Truscott's 3rd Division fought hard in Italy and by spring 1944, he was moved up to command of the U.S. VI Corps and planned the allied amphibious invasion of southern France in August 1944. By November 1944 he earned command of the Fifth U.S. Army in Italy and participated in the 1945 spring offensive that was instrumental in compelling German forces to surrender. At war's end, he was assigned command of the Third U.S. Army and the military district of Bavaria, with administrative responsibility for the Nuremburg trials in 1945-1946. After army retirement, in 1951 he served the C.I.A. in West Germany, coordinating the collection of intelligence on the Soviet Union. During his years with the CIA, he was promoted to general, retiring in 1959. 175 Years of Texas Independence * 1836 - 2011",False,False,True,32.2406512774451,-96.41144605839284

The seriousness of the situation was realized on June 26, 1942 when Mexican cargo ships were sunk by German u-boats within sight of Port O' Connor. The military established a protective watch area and residents patrolled beaches. One night a patrol discovered Germans coming ashore on Matagorda Peninsula and took them prisoner. The army installed a surveillance system between October 1940 and January 1941 in Port O' Connor, Port Lavaca and Olivia. Citizens were trained to identify and report airplanes within view. The Port Lavaca tower observed a man using a fishing pole to put up an antenna; he was transmitting information to German u-boats in the Gulf of Mexico. Turtle and Matagorda Bay provided shoreline for the division of artillery to practice and train. The United States Army selected nearby Camp Hulen as the base for anti-aircraft artillery training. Camp Indianola served as an anti-aircraft target practice area that used remote control drones called radio aircraft target service for practice. In 1943, the Matagorda Island Gunnery Range was built that supported training for the island bombing range.

Comal settlers were among some of the first Germans to emigrate to Texas in the 1840s. The Schwab, Friesenhahn, Wenzel, Fey, Schaefer, Syring and Sahm families established farms, some of which remain productive and run by descendants of these pioneering families. Throughout the 20th century, Comal remained a small and close-knit agricultural village. The Friesenhahn brothers, influenced by the communityâs reliance on cotton as a cash crop, organized a community cooperative gin in 1900 and established a corn shelling plant that served area farmers. Kneupperâs Grocery, in business from 1906 to 1973, provided the community with goods and was a center for social gatherings on Friday and Saturday evenings. A blacksmith shop, owned by the Wenzel and Schwab families, remains standing near the center of town. Most of the infrastructure is present as a reminder of the community. Education and religious commitment among the first settlers (both Catholic and Protestant) was a first priority and many of the Comal family patriarchs were instrumental leaders in forming the first school and church institutions in Comal as well as in New Braunfels.

In 1907, a two-story white brick school opened in Pflugerville on property donated by George Pfluger. Three young ladies comprised the first graduating class in 1911 by completing the 11th grade.

W. Pfluger were among early trustees. After completing sixth grade in rural schools, most area students came to Pflugerville to attend high school. In 1919, the Texas Legislature created the Pflugerville Independent School District (PISD). After consolidation with Highland, Dessau, Center Point and Rowe, a two-story red brick school was built on this site in 1921. The second story featured an auditorium for presentations and community events. Separate campuses were established for African-American and Mexican-American pupils.

In the 1780s, pathfinder JosÃ© Mares incorporated the link into a shorter route between Santa Fe and San Antonio. Maps, surveys and contemporary accounts include many variations of Pinta, all said to derive from the Spanish word pintar (to paint). Pinto ponies or the Piedra Pinta Mountains on period maps are two possible explanations. In 1839, John (Jack) Coffee Hays surveyed the area where the Pinta Trail crosses the Guadalupe River, designating the route as Paint Road. It became a consistent map feature soon after Texas statehood. In the 1840s, the German Adelsverein utilized the trail for access to its new settlements near the Pedernales River. Naturalists Ferdinand Lindheimer and Ferdinand von Roemer referenced the Pinta Trail in their 1845-47 excursions. Nicolaus Zink settled along the path in 1847, becoming the first pioneer in the future colony of Sisterdale. The trail's use diminished when new routes were established. Landscape artist Hermann Lungkwitz documented the historic road in his painting Old Pinta Crossing on the Guadalupe (1857). The trail went through the center of Kendall County. East of Boerne, it crossed the southern boundary of George Wilkins Kendall's ranch west of Post Oak Creek. The selection of the Pinta Trail as an ancient pathway stood the test of time. By connecting reliable water sources, good terrain and emerging settlements, the trail was an important factor in the development of the Hill Country and Kendall County.

At the turn of the century, automobiles were on the forefront of new technology and better roads were needed throughout the country for this growing form of transportation. In 1931, the new route for Texas Highway 159 passed by the Fisches farm. Willieâs wife, Annie, was an automobile enthusiast and supported the 1939 roadside park program that sought to beautify Texas roads.

The sugar mill, originally the Waterhouse Rice and Sugar Company, later became the Wharton County Irrigation Company. With construction of the Cane Belt Railroad from Sealy to Wharton, the townsite of Glen Flora was established in 1898 on the east bank of the Colorado River across from Waterhouse holdings, a prime location to access rail lines.

In 1902, the Glen Flora Town Company formed with Waterhouse as president; it reorganized in 1906 with G.C. Gifford as president. In 1903, the Cane Belt Railroad sold to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad who leased to the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe in 1905. Rail service ended in 1991 and the rails were removed. With its close proximity to transportation and farmland, Glen Flora became a fast-growing community with a hotel, bank, lumber yard, movie theater, telephone company, two cotton gins and more.

Cotton was not a major crop until the late 1880s when the Michot brothers, Eugene and Jules, built a cotton gin three miles south of present-day Long Mott. Jules ran a gin as early as 1895 in Port Lavaca along present West Main Street. Calhoun Countyâs early gins utilized the continuous âsystem ginningâ developed by Robert S. Munger. In this system, the cotton was vacuumed from a loaded wagon, cleaned, and pressed into 500-pound bales. This system would endure until post-WWII mechanization allowed farmers to greatly increase their cotton yield. The 1940s, 50s, and 60s saw a dramatic increase in cotton production. Calhoun County had reported five bales in 1860 and 10,500 in 1940. In the 1950s, the townâs two existing gins, The Farmers and The Boyd, were moved outside of the city.

He offered up his home, known as âBrushy Knob,â as a place for children to learn. As the need for education grew, Schmidt donated one acre of his property for a school. In the late 1870s, a local committee was formed which submitted that the school be named âRichland,â in reference to the areaâs rich Blackland soil. In 1878, a one-room schoolhouse was built. The first teacher was Catharine Schlittler, who was followed by several German-speaking minister/teachers. Unhappy with part-time instructors lecturing in German, the community applied to the state to supply funds for a full-time, English-speaking teacher. This request was granted around the same time the school was expanded. In 1883, a larger schoolhouse was built over the site of the original building. In 1905, the community voted to expand the schoolhouse and bring in another teacher. A separate room was built in 1920 to house primary grades. In 1927, the community voted to once again improve the school grounds by constructing a modern, three-room schoolhouse. The original 1883 building was moved off site, the 1905 addition demolished, and the 1920 structure converted into a club house.

  In 1880, the Salem School was called School Community No. 33. In 1886, church members voted to open the school to the public. Known then as the Salem Community Public School, it was instructed by the church pastor, Reverend F. Jesse. A second room was added to the school by 1914 and land from the Nelson Smith League was added from William and Hannah Kemper. A 1918 survey recorded Salem as a two-room school with two teachers and seven grades. Longtime head teacher, John H. Addicks, started teaching in 1919 and was both principal and instructor for 44 years.
  William Wehmeyer petitioned to open Salem Community Schools No. 27 and 34 in 1889 and 1891, respectively. He then donated land from the Nelson Smith league to the school trustees in 1895. In 1909, schools were combined into districts created Salem District No. 4. Eventually the community school districts began consolidating when the Wonder Hill School was closed in 1954. Its students were then bused to Salem School for two years, at which point, Salem was consolidated with the Pleasant Hill School. Pleasant Hill School closed in 1987 and students were sent to Brenham Independent School District, reflecting the end to more than a century of education in the community.

The Galveston movement, a humanitarian effort that brought nearly 10,000 Jewish immigrants through the Port of Galveston between 1907 and 1914, was initiated to address these issues by dispersing Jews throughout the U.S. Jacob Schiff, a banker and philanthropist, championed the idea of bringing Jews to the south. He was the sole donor of the plan, pledging $500,000. Galveston was chosen because its railroads and relatively small size would encourage immigrants to move elsewhere. It was also home to Rabbi Henry Cohen, leader of the local reform synagogue BâNai Israel, and a small but thriving Jewish community. The first ship to arrive under the plan was the S.S. Cassel, on July 1, 1907, from Bremen, Germany; 86 of the passengers were Jewish. Cohen welcomed the new immigrants, as he would every group that came during the program. The arrivals were processed at the Jewish Immigrantsâ Information Bureau (JIIB) Headquarters. JIIB workers informed them of communities needing workers of varying skills and gave the immigrants railroad tickets and rations. More than 150 towns requested that the JIIB send skilled workers.

David volunteered along with another soldier to swim across and explore the surrounding German territory. Despite resistance, Barkley made it across, crawled 400 yards behind enemy lines, and drew the required maps. On his swim back through enemy fire, Barkley was seized with cramps and drowned. His exhausted scouting partner was able to return with the information they had gathered together. Two days later, the Armistice went into effect. Private Barkley was commended by General John Pershing and was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was then one of only three Texans to have been given the decoration in the war. He also received the Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster, Victory Medal, Croix de Guerre from France and Croce al Merito di Guerra from Italy. In 1921, his body lay in state at the Alamo, only the second person to have that honor. He is buried under the name David B. Barkley in San Antonio National Cemetery. In 1989, David Barkley's Hispanic heritage was revealed, thus spurring the Army to recognize him as the first Hispanic Medal of Honor recipient.

Nordan (1896-1969) was a successful oil and gas producer in south Texas. In 1949, he and his wife, Pearl (Neugent) Nordan (1896-1994), established the 711 Ranch in Comal County along the Guadalupe River, 18 miles northwest of New Braunfels. The ranch was named after Nordan's downtown San Antonio business address. He was appointed to the Texas State Parks Board in 1951. The Nordans contributed generously to education, the arts, their church, and medical research. Starting in the 1850s, this area was part of the Fischer Store, Rebecca Creek and Cranes Mill settlements. In eight transactions between 1949 and 1966, the Nordans purchased 51 parcels of property rooted in 35 individual land grants awarded between 1837 and 1888 to Republic of Texas patriots, railroads, Mexican Texans, and German and Swiss immigrants. The ranch extended from North Cranes Mill Road west to Devils Hollow and one mile south of the river over 7.5 miles northward. The Nordans created a world-class ranching operation, producing prize-winning Santa Gertrudis cattle and Columbia sheep. They focused on conservation, wildlife preservation and education. They valued their many talented, long-term employees. The ranch owners took care to preserve Ninteenth-century structures and cemeteries located on the sprawling property. From 1961 to 1963, almost 2,000 acres were acquired by the U.S. government for the Canyon Lake Reservoir. In 1999, some 7,180 acres of ranch land was sold and soon became the Mystic Shores subdivision. The contributions of L.A. and Pearl Nordan significantly added to the rich heritage of the area.

German immigrants moved to this area in droves after Friedrich Ernst (1796-1848) arrived in 1831 and wrote descriptions of Texas to be published in Germany. The Germans created fraternal associations devoted to literature, singing, agriculture, sportsmanship and mutual aid. The Schuetzenverein kept up the sporting tradition deriving from medieval Europe when contests on marksmanship and archery were conducted to maintain a community's skills in case of combat. However, dancing became the building's main activity.
  The first structure was a dance platform built on the Hoff family pasture in 1898-99. German immigrant Joachim Hintz (1841-1920) built an eight-sided hall that included a large dance floor and a cupola for ventilation. Dances were held every second Saturday of the month. Only men would pay admission and there are tales of women using pieces of their calico dresses as tickets in the early 1900s. The popular events included May Fest, masquerades, and Christmas and New Year's dances. In 1943, Peters Hall was renamed Austin County Gun Club before becoming Peters-Hacienda Community Hall in 1995.
  The town of Peters, also known as Millheim Station, was named after an early resident, Albert Peters (1882-1958). In the 1870's, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was extended near the community, and a post office was open from 1883 to the mid-1940s. The town had several businesses, a church, a hospital and two schools: Peters School and Hacienda School. Although these places are gone, the hall still stands, preserving and creating new memories.     (2019)",False,False,True,29.853109612788987,-96.18884668304887

On March 2, 1850, the singing society ""Germania"" was organized in New Braunfels under direction of Gottfried Joseph Petmecky (1809-1871). The group sponsored their first singing event at that year's Fourth of July celebration on the banks of the Comal River. Many cities and towns in Texas with large German populations formed similar groups, and in 1853, the first statewide Saengerfest was held in New Braunfels, on Friedrich Hermann Seele's farm on the Guadalupe River. By 1876, other singing societies formed in Comal County included the New Braunfelser Maennerchor, Echo Society, Smithson Valley Echo Society, Anhalt Singing Society, Honey Creek Singing Society, and Walhalla Singing Society at Sattler. Early societies were only for men, but by 1895, mixed-voice societies included the Concordia Gemischter Chor.
  On November 13, 1937, Gilbert A. Becker (1906-1985) organized the New Braunfels Gemischter Chor Harmonie. Becker was a farmer, singer and music director whose father, Heinrich Becker (1860-1925), was a charter member of the Clear Spring Frohsinn Singing Society. The group numbered 46 members by 1938 and was recognized as one of the best mixed-voice singing societies in the region. New members were selected competitively, voted on anonymously by the membership using a system of black and white balls. By the 1990s, the group was the only remaining German singing society in New Braunfels. Initially focused on saengerfests, the group expanded to holidays, community festivals and other special events. Many members have joined the society to improve their German language proficiency. Though it was the last local German singing society formed after nearly a century of tradition, the group continues to preserve and promote this important aspect of cultural heritage.

The Pinta Trail a few miles to the east initially overshadowed the Camino San Saba in popularity, but both were used by German settlers from the 1840s onward.

Grist was the first licensed veterinarian in the county and could often be found on-site at farms, checking on animals and educating farmers on disease prevention and good nutrition. He met Elizabeth Ann (Betty) Wille (1919-2007) in 1937 when she brought her sisterâs dog into his newly opened practice at 637 W. San Antonio Street. After receiving a scholarship to study sanitation, he began working for the Texas State Health Department Food and Drug Division. In 1943, he was elected Texas State Veterinarian. In this position, and as the city meat inspector, he enforced sanitary practices on local slaughterhouses, which were often sources of sickness due to lack of regulation. 
  In 1949, Dr. Grist bought 20.3 acres at 727 N. Live Oak Ave. and built the New Braunfels Veterinary Hospital, opening his practice in 1950. In the 1950s, he battled rabies and anthrax outbreaks in the county and continued to educate community members on healthy practices. After receiving a letter in which his son, John, described German village festivals with sausage, beer, and dancing, Dr. Grist had the idea to replicate the festival in New Braunfels, a prolific sausage making area. âWurstfestâ was a one-day event in 1961 but has grown to a multiple day event benefitting the local economy and numerous charities. In the 1970s, Dr. Grist retired from veterinary medicine and became the county sanitarian. His last decades were filled with civic work. His legacy lives on not only in the community but throughout the entire state.  (2022)",False,False,True,29.695030931317614,-98.14617126840082
